# Food-Vision-101

This repository contains the code and resources for a food classification project using transfer learning. The goal of this project is to accurately classify food images into different categories using deep learning and transfer learning techniques. 

## Introduction
Food classification is a challenging task due to the high variability in food appearance and the presence of multiple ingredients in different combinations. Transfer learning, a technique in deep learning, enables us to leverage pre-trained models on large-scale datasets and adapt them to specific tasks with limited training data. In this project, we utilize transfer learning to build a food classification model that can accurately categorize food images.

## Dataset
We have used a publicly available food dataset for training and evaluation. The dataset consists of thousands of food images belonging to various categories such as fruits, vegetables, desserts, etc. Each image is labeled with its corresponding category to facilitate supervised learning.
